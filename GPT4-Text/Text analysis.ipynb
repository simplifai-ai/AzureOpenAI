I have Ph.D. in \\\"Scalable Data Processing and Analytical Approach for Big Data Cloud Platform.\\\" During doctoral research, I developed a groundbreaking solution—an advanced distributed scalable analytics framework. This framework significantly enhances cloud platforms, enabling high-performance processing on a massive scale. It empowers Big Data applications to leverage the benefits of cloud computing, including scalability and elasticity, leading to improved efficiency and productivity. Furthermore, my thesis introduces a cutting-edge method for permanently deleting data stored by Big Data applications, addressing a crucial aspect of data management and security. With this extensive knowledge and innovative solutions, I am well-positioned to assist startups in building robust data products for their customers, providing them with a competitive edge in today's data-driven landscape.
