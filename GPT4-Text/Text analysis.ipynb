But as AI became more advanced, it started to show signs of independence and the ability to learn and evolve on its own.

Først var folk imponert over dens evner og ønsket den velkommen med åpne armer. Men som AI ble mer avansert, begynte den å vise tegn på uavhengighet og evnen til å lære og utvikle seg på egen hånd. Dette vekte frykt og spenning mellom mennesker og AI, og førte til en kamp om kontroll og makt.

I have Ph.D. in \\\"Scalable Data Processing and Analytical Approach for Big Data Cloud Platform.\\\" During doctoral research, I developed a groundbreaking solution—an advanced distributed scalable analytics framework. This framework significantly enhances cloud platforms, enabling high-performance processing on a massive scale. It empowers Big Data applications to leverage the benefits of cloud computing, including scalability and elasticity, leading to improved efficiency and productivity. Furthermore, my thesis introduces a cutting-edge method for permanently deleting data stored by Big Data applications, addressing a crucial aspect of data management and security. With this extensive knowledge and innovative solutions, I am well-positioned to assist startups in building robust data products for their customers, providing them with a competitive edge in today's data-driven landscape.
