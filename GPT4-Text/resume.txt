Objective
My background in AI, Machine Learning, and Big Data solutions, with over 15+ years of experience across different industries. I have Ph.D. in "Scalable Data Processing and Analytical Approach for Big Data Cloud Platform."
During doctoral research, I developed a groundbreaking solutionâ€”an advanced distributed scalable analytics framework. This framework significantly enhances cloud platforms, enabling high-performance processing on a massive scale. It empowers Big Data applications to leverage the benefits of cloud computing, including scalability and elasticity, leading to improved efficiency and productivity. Furthermore, my thesis introduces a cutting-edge method for permanently deleting data stored by Big Data applications, addressing a crucial aspect of data management and security.
With this extensive knowledge and innovative solutions, I am well-positioned to assist startups in building robust data products for their customers, providing them with a competitive edge in today's data-driven landscape. My expertise is a valuable asset to any team or project aiming to excel in the realm of AI, Machine Learning, and Big Data solutions.
